print("Gil-galad was an Even-king.")
print("Of him the harpers sadly sing:")
print("the last whose realm was fair and free")
print("between the Mountains and the Sea.\n")

print("His sword was long, his lance was keen,")
print("his shining helm afar was seen;")
print("the countless stars of heaven's field")
print("were mirrored in his silver shield.\n")

print("But long ago he rode away,")
print("and where he dwelleth none can say;")
print("for into darkness fell his star")
print("in Mordor where the shadows are.")
